# Conway's Game of Life in Go

This implements an HTTP server in Go that deploys a JS file that implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The JS file is actually Go code compiled to JS using [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

A deployed version of this app can be found [here](http://conwayslife.herokuapp.com/).
